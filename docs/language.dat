% This is language.dat as of November 25th, 1997 at (your site)
%
% This file coming from the distrib. "french" is "babel" compatible
%                                                (since V3.6 of Babel)
%
% This file tells TeX which are the languages and dialects, 
%                     which are the hyphenation files (patterns),
%                 and which are the hyphenation exception files.
%                     (For syntax look at the bottom.)
%
% CHECK IF THIS IS THE ONLY language.dat FILE OF YOUR SYSTEM, otherwise
% remove (or rename) all unused, and keep just (this) one.

%=============================================================================%
% Each of the three parts (language_name, patterns_file and exceptions_file)
% must be separated by a blank space. You can omit any of the file names if 
% your language has not this component.
%
% First language will have language number 0 when used by hyconfig.tex
% at an INITeX time or used by french.sty version > 3.
%                      (once INITeX is done don't change the language order!)
%
% An "=" in front of the language name means that this language must use the
% same language number that the previous language. 
% So you can use the equal sign to define dialects.
% If this is the first language then the next language will be numbered 0 too; 
% the language name is the only thing used here; patterns and  exceptions file
% are never taken in account in this special dialect case.
%
% At INITeX time, the basic files to congigurate are:
% - language.dat, (that file you are reading!),
% - plain.tex for plain TeX format, which calls "\input hyphen".
%   In order to use "language.dat" for language definition you have to replace
%   "\input hyphen" by "\input hyphen.cfg". Then do as for LaTeX:
% - hyphen.cfg for LaTeX format which will load the master hyphenation code 
%   hyconfig.tex that does the job of loading the appropriate files. 
%(- lthyphen.tex for old LaTeX 2.09 versions)
%
% Notice that "enhyph.tex" and "enhyphex.tex" are often derivates of the
% original "hyphen.tex" (in fact only a split between patterns and exceptions).
% But you must know that english (ie british) patterns exist. See archives. 
%
% Notice also that few TeX engines may require non-empty hyphenation
% "exceptions file" fields. In such cases provide null.tex.
