Authors :

. Alexandre Fenyö (alex@asim.lip6.fr, fenyo@enst.fr) :

  - maintainer of the whole software distribution

  - 1st version of the emulator

  - user-level applications :
    hslclient     (RPC transport and configuration client)
    hslserver     (RPC transport and configuration server)
    getevents     (kernel events retriever)
    vmspace       (memory analyser)
    init_pcibus   (configuration of PCI bus)
    readpci       (read from PCI configuration space on a device)
    writepci      (write to PCI configuration space on a device)
    readphys      (direct read in physical memory)
    writephys     (direct write in physical memory)
    dumpPCIDDC    (dump the internal tables used by PCI-DDC)
    dumptables    (dump internal tables used by SLR/SCP)
    testputbench  (benchmark and test program for layer PUT)
    testputrecv   (test program for layer PUT)
    testputsend   (direct access to PUT API)
    prot_dump     (dump the MPC-OS vm map entries used to wire data)
    prot_garbcoll (start a garbage collection inside the MPC-OS vm map entries)
    ...

  - mpcview : a graphical interface to manage PCI-DDC

  - user-level layer PUT (useraccess library)

  - examples of use (addlpe, fetchobj, on, off, receivelpe, testrecv,
                     testrecv2, testrecv2wait, testrecvv, testsend, testsend2,
                     testsend2wait, testsendv, testuseraccess, vmtest,
                     prot_wire)

  - basic kernel communication layers :
    driver, PUT, SLR/P, SLR/V

  - optimized implementation of secure layers : DDSCP, RFCP, SFCP, MICP
    (this is a new optimized implementation, distinct from the first one made
     by K. Mana)

  - high level kernel communications layers :
    MDCP, SELECT

  - advanced memory locking system (wiring the ranges of virtual addresses
    during inter-nodes DMA)

  - multithreaded object request broker development toolkit

  - manager for negociation of resources
    (built on top of the multithreaded ORB)

  - user-lever libmpc library to access communication services from MDCP
    and high level services from the Manager (SLR{P,V} and MDCP channels
    allocation, spawning tasks...)

  - Sockets (connected mode only) emulation on top of libmpc

  - autoconfiguration (aclocal/automake/autoconf)

  - ported the whole package from FreeBSD-2.1.0 to FreeBSD-2.2.5, FreeBSD-3.0
    and FreeBSD-3.1

  - ported interval routing program from Sparc/Linux to FreeBSD

  - integration of the interval routing program in this package

  - support for the FastHSL board - PCI-DDC/Rcube
    (with help of Franck Wasjburt)

  - mle2raw.pl : conversion utility from mle format to R3 raw routing
                 tables format

  - wrote the software documentations

. Karim Mana :

  - coded the first implementation of the secure kernel communication layers
    (not included in this package)

  - integrated the reconfigurable version and the secure layers version
    into a single package (not included in this package)

. Fabrice Ilpons & Abdelhafid Bouaraoua :

  - routing tables calculation (ir utility for Sparc/Linux : interval routing)

. Some students (Maitrises de Sciences et Techniques) :

  - 1st version of the monitor (dynamically reconfigurable version of MPC-OS,
    not included in this package)
