mpc-1.0         (Jan    1996) :
	First implementation of PUT.
	This version has never been released.
	
mpc-1.1         (Feb 26 1996) :
	Layer PUT available, SLR/P under construction.

mpc-2.0 Alpha 1 (Mar 27 1996) :
	Layer SLR/P available, but no debug stage done.

mpc-2.0 Beta 1  (May 13 1996) :
	Lots of bugs fixes in SLR/P.

mpc-2.0 Beta 2  (May 20 1996) :
	Bugs fixes in SLR/P.
	Intensive tests of layer PUT.

mpc-2.0         (May 22 1996) :
	Layer SLR/V available.

mpc-3.0	Alpha   (Jul  8 1996) :
	Lots of comments added to the sources.
	The distribution is split into a tree.
	Autoconf is added to generate the configure script.
	Automake is added to generate Makefile.in.

mpc-4.0	        (Dec  22 1997) :
	Lots of bug fixes...
	The package was ported to FreeBSD-2.2.5
	Added : support of the FastHSL board.
	Added : software fixes for hardware bugs of the first run of PCI-DDC chip :
	        support of normal aligned messages.
	Added : testput{bench,recv,send}, utility to bench and test layer PUT.
	Added : dumpPCIDDC : utility to dump the internal tables used by PCI-DDC.
	Added : optimized secure layers handling hardware faults :
 	        DDSCP, RFCP, SFCP, MICP.
	Added : multithreaded object request broker development toolkit.
	In project : manager for negociation of resources
 	             (based on the multithreaded ORB).
	Added : automatic calculation of RCube routing tables based on a description
	        of the network topology.
	Added : mpcview : a graphical interface to manage PCI-DDC.

mpc-4.1         (Jan 1998) :
        New bug fixes...
        Added : advanced memory locking system that wires the ranges of virtual
                addresses during inter-nodes DMA.

mpc-4.2         (Feb 1998) :
	New bug fixes...
	Minor changes.

mpc-4.3         (Mar 14 1998) :
	New bug fixes...
	Added : many additions to the ORB (but it is not already functionnal)

mpc-5.0	        (Apr 1998) :
	multithreaded object request broker development toolkit released.
	manager (based on the multithreaded ORB) works pretty well.
	Added : MDCP, a new layer on top of SLR/P, providing input/output buffering.
	        MDCP provides read/write primitives without any callback function
		to handle -> easier to use than lower level kernel layers.
		Note that MDCP is still `zero-copy' if the write() primitive
		is called before the read() one.
	Added : SELECT implementation to wait for events on file descriptors
	        and channels in the same time.
	Added : the Loader daemon handles task activation.
	Added : the manager now handles new task activation (throw communications
	        with the Loader daemon), application classes creation (task
		managment), channel negociations between tasks and
		allocation/deallocation	of kernel data structures for
		communication end-points.
	Added : libmpc user level library allowing the user to make requests
	        to the manager (spawn tasks, channel allocation...) and to
		the MDCP kernel layer.
	Added : libsocketwrap is a shared object that wraps the socket API
	        and maps those syscalls into libmpc calls. This library
		can be dynamically linked into any application to provide
		a binary compatible port to MPC-OS.
		libsocketwrap has been tested with the MPICH implementation
		of MPI, on a 2 nodes MPC computer (testbench : distributed
		computation of PI).
		libsocketwrap needs a little work to become fully functionnal
		with other high level toolkits.
	        
mpc-5.1         (Feb 1999) :
	The documentation (directory docs) is removed : a pointer to the
	web server (http://mpc.lip6.fr) replaces the whole documentation.
	The package is ported to FreeBSD-3.0.
	Some bug fixes are performed.

mpc-5.1.1	(Feb 2000) :
	Added: support for PCI-DDC 2nd Run.
